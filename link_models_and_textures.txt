boomerang

  No known issues or limitations.
bottlecap

  No known issues or limitations.
bow
  Bow
  Make sure that all 3 of the meshes remain weighted to 2 or more bones. Which specific bones they are can be changed. But reducing the number of bones one of the bow's meshes is weighted to down to only 1 will cause the game to crash when the player takes the bow out.
camera
  Picto Box
  No known issues or limitations.

  No known issues or limitations.
fan
  Deku Leaf (version used when blowing a gust of wind)
  Be careful not to remove duplicate vertices from the leaf - its two sides are perfectly overlapping but have opposite normals, so removing duplicates would screw it up and merge the two sides into one.
  Also make sure that mesh-1 is weighted to at least 2 bones. If it is weighted to only 1 bone, then mesh-0 will not be hidden when the player runs out of MP like it's supposed to be.
fanb
  Deku Leaf (version used when gliding)
  No known issues or limitations.
fansmall
  Deku Leaf (version held in your hand when idle)
  Make sure that both of the meshes remain weighted to 2 or more bones. Which specific bones they are can be changed. But reducing the number of bones one of the meshes is weighted to down to only 1 will cause the game to crash when the player takes the small Deku Leaf out.

shms
  Mirror Shield
  It's recommended that you change the weighting so that all vertices are weighted to every single bone. If you do that it removes the subtle effect of the shield bending when hit, but if you don't this model tends to have tons of issues ingame.
